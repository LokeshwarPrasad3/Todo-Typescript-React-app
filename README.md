# Todo App with TypeScript and React

This is a simple Todo app built with TypeScript and React using Vite as the build tool.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

- Requirements 
  1. Node.js must be installed on your local system.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LokeshwarPrasad3/Todo-Typescript-React-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:
   ```
   cd todo-tsx-app
   ```
      Install the project dependencies:
         ```
         npm install
         ```

      Start the development server:
         ```
         npm run dev
         ```
3. By default, the app will be accessible at: 
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Using a Mobile Browser
  If you want to use the app on a mobile browser, you can do so by running the development server with a custom host. To do this, run the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev -- --host

   ```
